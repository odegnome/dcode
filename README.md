# Implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Collision Prevention in Quadrotor

This repo contains code and dissertation report from my Master's course. Code relevant
to training the policy and testing the performance has been added, but some irrelevant
part has been omitted. However, should someone feel that the code in incomplete, please
raise an [Issue](https://github.com/odegnome/dcode/issues) and I'll see what I can do.

The dissertation report should also be available in the same repo.

Good luck.
